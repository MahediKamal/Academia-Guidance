Upon installation in this way, MySQL creates a user account named `root`. his user has full privileges over the MySQL server. itâ€™s best to avoid using this account outside of administrative functions. Create other user account to do normal DB operations. To acess the root user type `sudo mysql`(if you have installed in this way) in command line. this root don't require any password. After login to `root` create other user for use.
</br>

`CREATE USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED WITH authentication_plugin BY 'password';` to create new user here username=new DB user name, host=db host, if you plan to use db locally then set host=localhost, password=give a password. and then give permission to the user, `GRANT PRIVILEGE ON database.table TO 'username'@'host';`

### configure mysql 
```
  sudo mysql  // in password give your ubuntu password

  CREATE USER 'therap'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '1234';

  GRANT CREATE, ALTER, DROP, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT, REFERENCES, RELOAD on *.* TO 'therap'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION;

  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

  exit;
